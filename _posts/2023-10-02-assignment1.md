## **Assignment 1 With Afra**


## Part 1:
 
Explore the HAM website as well as the csv file of All Objects (found in the posit-cloud project). 

*Choose a few pieces from the collections of interest to you*

[Piece 1 - Website](https://harvardartmuseums.org/article/reconstructing-the-staff-of-em-nydia-the-blind-flower-girl-of-pompeii-em)

[Piece 2 - Website](https://harvardartmuseums.org/exhibitions/6321/a-colloquium-in-the-visual-arts)

[Piece 3 - CSV](https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/39985-)

[Piece 4 - CSV](https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/297197)

[Piece 5 - CSV](https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/40250)




*Was the website or the csv file easier to use?*

**Amal:** While the website aids in exploring the museum visually, I found the CSV file more fun to use because you don’t know what you’re going to get until you paste the link and analyze the image. What was especially interesting to me was to compare what I’ve imagined based solely on the title to what the actual drawing is. 

**Afra:** The website was easier to navigate, it showed me the art piece directly and it didn’t require so much effort. Therefore, I found it easier for me from the csv file which was time consuming. 

What are you able to say about the art pieces from their metadata?

**Afra:** The art pieces according to their metadata are organized according to dates and object type. For example, all the photographs are placed in a specific order according to date. 

**Amal:** The metadata in the csv file lists almost everything that the website does. For example; titles, classification, type, date, and potential place of origin, period and culture. The metadata compiles all that information in a singular file to help researchers find particular pieces that are in correspondence to their research.

## Part 2: 

*Use the notebook to determine for a given culture what the most viewed items are in the HAM website?*

We looked at Islamic Cultures, and according to the information on Posit cloud, these are the results:

*Describe the origin of these objects?* 

The five top viewed objects originated mostly from the middle east, specifically Syria, Iran, Iraq and Turkey.  However, Lintel fourth in the list is from Morocco. 
The five lowest viewed objects, 

These objects originated from the Islamic Culture but that can mean so many places, Middle East, Syria and Egypt

*Can you speculate on why the most and least viewed objects are what they are?* 

The most viewed artifact is related to the prophet mohammed. Due to its historical and religious background, it can be the reason why it’s considered the most important, therefore most viewed. 

The least viewed objects are either repetitive take the Islamic Coin as an example, it is mentioned 3 times in the least viewed objects, additionally some objects don’t even have an image uploaded on the website. Or, these objects have been recently uploaded to the Harvard Art Museum. And, upon further insight, it seems like the Harvard Art Museum didn’t reach the conclusion that islamic culture could mean so many things, And that the Islamic Culture belongs to many cultures.

*Are these numbers surprising to you?* 

It was, and I wasn’t expecting the numbers to be that high. Especially for the most viewed object, I didn't expect it to be related to the prophet mohammed. 

Not really, because the least viewed objects aren’t organized and don’t really carry much information about 

*Using the accession year data and the time series bar chart, what can you say about the acquisition of works coming from these three cultures?*



![The Code For The Bar Chart](/assets/images/barchart.jpg)






*Do they tell you something about the relative popularity of art in a university museum in the United States?* 

The trends in the bar chart above show barely visible data about the counts of accession when it comes to the Iraqi culture pieces and objects throughout the years. However, Egyptian culture seems to be the second runner up in our group of cultures, where you can see a visible spike in the 1920s and the 1970s; we believe that this might be because of the general popularity of Egyptian culture worldwide, and that these spikes aren’t that significant nor surprising. But, the major eye catcher would have to be the obvious increase of the Byzantine objects and pieces in the 1950s, upon research we couldn’t find a historical or political reasoning, but, what we came to a conclusion that the Byzantine Empire was very christian and ruled by constantine even after the fall of the Roman Empire, and in correlation to the fact that the USA is a christian-majority country we believe that this might be a reason why the where is a sharp rise in accession maybe because of donors or some other reason. 

*Can you compare it to other museums you have visited or know about?*

It is important to understand that a museum located in a specific region would prioritize its own culture and similar cultures because of similarity in history, religion, heritage, etc. 



## Part 3: 

*Using a choice of three cultures and the notebook, build a word cloud based on the combined descriptions and titles of the objects from those cultures.* 

Our choice of three cultures were: Byzantine, Iraqi and Egyptian cultures



![The Code For The Word Clouds](/assets/images/wordclouds.jpg)







*Does this summary of the words tell us something about the way that cultures are important in a US art museum?* 

The words that appear for all three cultures give us a background on their artifacts and historical arts that are seen as important to the US art museum. For example, for the Byzantine culture, the word Crown, Cross, and Bust are the most apparent which indicates that the artifacts are related to those words. In regards to the Iraqi culture, the word Fire is the biggest which could be relevant to the history of Iraq, and lastly the Egyptian culture where the most vibrant word is Sherd. Therefore, this is seen as crucial for the US art museum as it tells them more about the history by giving them a broad view of the specific culture.
  
*Use the stop word function to remove certain words to “dig in” to the textual data a bit more? When you remove very high frequency words what do you discover?* 

 When we remove very high frequency words out of the stop word function, the word cloud gets filled with more words that are unnecessary and very irrelevant to the culture. On the other hand, if I put a hashtag and deactivate the stopword function, more words will appear, such as and and of 

*Compare your results across cultures.*

This occurs across the three cultures, the high frequency words disappear (as expected) however the original stopwords get enlarged and original low frequency words come to the foreground.
