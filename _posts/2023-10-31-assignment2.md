## About: 
 
Agatha Christie, born in 1890 and passing away in 1976, stands as a luminary in the realm of British literature, celebrated for her outstanding contributions to the mystery and detective fiction genre. Renowned as the "Queen of Mystery," she holds a well-deserved place among the best-selling authors in the world. In this exploration, we'll focus on three of her iconic works, each a testament to her storytelling prowess.

- "The Mysterious Affair at Styles" (1920)
Agatha Christie's literary journey commenced with "The Mysterious Affair at Styles," her debut novel. Published in 1920, it introduced readers to the enigmatic Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot. Poirot, known for his brilliant deductive skills and reliance on his "little gray cells," takes center stage in this tale. The plot revolves around the murder of Emily Inglethorp, setting the stage for a riveting and intricate mystery that marks the beginning of Christie's impressive career.
- "The Murder on the Links" (1923)
Christie's literary brilliance shone through once more in "The Murder on the Links," a detective novel released in 1923. This early work showcases her famous Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, in a thrilling narrative that keeps readers on the edge of their seats. The story unfolds as Poirot is summoned to solve the mystery of a murder that occurs on a golf course, with Christie's signature intricate details and cleverly constructed puzzles taking center stage.
- "The Big Four"
In "The Big Four," Agatha Christie adheres to her signature style of detective fiction. The novel immerses readers in a world of intrigue and suspense as Hercule Poirot confronts a formidable adversary—an international crime syndicate known as "The Big Four." This shadowy organization comprises four powerful and brilliant individuals, each driven by their own nefarious agendas. The novel weaves a complex narrative as Poirot matches wits with this enigmatic cabal, resulting in a high-stakes and captivating story.

Agatha Christie's contribution to the world of mystery fiction remains unparalleled, with her intricate plots, compelling characters, and masterful storytelling captivating readers for generations. Her creation of Hercule Poirot, a detective whose "little gray cells" unlock the most puzzling mysteries, has left an indelible mark on the genre, and her ability to craft compelling narratives ensures her place as one of the most celebrated authors in literary history.

## Answering questions on the analysis we made on the three books of Agatha Christie 


1. What did you know about the subject before you began your analysis?
Before embarking on our analysis, our initial knowledge about the subjects primarily revolved around Agatha Christie's reputation as a British writer and her global renown as a prolific author in the murder mystery genre. Her name evoked a sense of intrigue and anticipation, with an expectation of thrilling and captivating narratives. However, this preliminary knowledge barely scratched the surface of the intricate layers of her literary contributions and the fascinating insights we would uncover through our analysis.
2. What does computer-assisted analysis allow you to see that you wouldn’t have seen in a linear read? Would a linear read have been possible in the time frame allotted?
Using voyant tools for our corpus, we were able to produce a word cloud that included an analysis of the most used words in the three books. With that happening, we concluded that Agatha Christie's books are similar in a way where all her books tie to the same theme, murder mystery. For instance, the most frequent word used in those three books was Poirot, which is  a fictional character created by Agatha Christie and is one of the most iconic and beloved detectives in the world of detective fiction. 

3. Was the format in which the corpus reached you sufficient for your purposes? What are some of the shortcomings of the texts?
The format from voyant tools was really helpful in our favor, specifically the tool of filtering unnecessary words and being able to analyze in not only a word cloud but other visualization. However one of the shortcomings of the texts was that it took us a long time to realize how the characters are interlinked. Including the fact that the word Poitrot was refering to the detective and we wouldn’t have known this unless we did some research. 

4. What is a trend you can identify in the materials? What are you able to learn by looking 
As we delved into the analysis using Voyant Tools, we were afforded a unique opportunity to explore the textual intricacies of Agatha Christie's works. Voyant Tools served as a lens through which we could scrutinize the narratives more deeply. It allowed us to identify one of the central and enduring characters in the Agatha Christie franchise—the iconic Belgian detective known as Poirot. The textual analysis unveiled how this beloved character, Hercule Poirot, consistently played a pivotal role in Christie's works. Poirot's presence, actions, and deductions are intricately woven into the fabric of her stories. Through the lens of Voyant Tools, we gained a clearer understanding of the prominence and impact of this fictional detective, who has left an indelible mark on the world of detective fiction. This tool facilitated a more comprehensive appreciation of the narrative elements that make Agatha Christie's works so captivating and enduring.

5. Were there any surprises in your exploration?
A particularly intriguing discovery emerged from our analysis when we noticed that the word "man" held a prominent position within the three selected Agatha Christie novels. This observation sparked curiosity and led us to ponder the significance of this linguistic pattern within her narratives. Upon reflection, it becomes apparent that the books were penned in the early 20th century, a time when societal norms and gender roles were significantly different from contemporary standards. In this historical context, men often held dominant positions in various aspects of life. This societal dynamic appears to be mirrored in Agatha Christie's writing, where the word "man" consistently makes its presence felt.
 
6. How well would this assignment work for a language other than English?
In our personal opinion, this would work well in languages similar to English, like the ones using the same alphapet; french, spanish etc. But with arabic, I feel it will be particularly difficult, as arabic has many ways of saying something like with past and present, will be the same word but with a different way of writing. So, this assignment will work for some languages but not all that are in a different alphapet like arabic.
